seqHMM 1.0.7 (Release date: 2017-04-04)
==============

* Added supplementary vignettes for visualization, estimation, and theoretical 
  background.
* Corrected a "feature" of the scaled forward-backward algorithm which caused 
  potential numerical issues in backward probabilities. More specifically, 
  previously the scaled backward variable at time t was scaled with the scaling 
  factors c_[t+1] of the forward variable, instead of c_t. In typical 
  applications this did not cause any problems, but some models which previously 
  caused problems can work now without resorting to the log-space algorithm.
* Scaling factors used in forward-backward algorithms are now stored as 1/c_t,
  where c_t are the scaling factors from older versions of seqHMM.
* The build_mm function now automatically estimates model parameters from the 
  observed initial state distribution and transition counts.
* Added automatic starting values for build_hmm, build_mhmm, build_mmm, and 
  build_lcm.
  
Bug fixes:

* Fixed a bug from version 1.0.6 where the EM algorithm with restarts did not 
  work as efficiently as intended due to changes in initializing emission matrices. 
  More specifically, the previous version used Rcpp sugar which does not use deep 
  copies in case of arma::cubes, which resulted the subsequent EM runs to depend 
  on the first optimum (affecting especially the identification of non-zero 
  emission probabilities).
* Fixed a bug in the ssp function where tlim was taken account of after sorting 
  sequences and computing hidden paths (now cases are chosen before other actions).


seqHMM 1.0.6 (Release date: 2016-08-01)
==============

* Argument diag_c in simulate_transition_probs is now used also in cases where
  left_right = FALSE.
* Adjusted reltol and maxeval values for EM algorithm. Now reltol is 1e-10
  (previously 1e-12), and the reltol and maxeval values for restarts are by
  default taken from the initial EM algorithm (previosly reltol was 1e-8 and
  maxeval = 100 for restarts).
* Fixed hidden states labels for ssp functions (previously always used the 
  default values).

Bug fixes:

* The ssplot function assigned wrong colors for hidden states in cases where
  the state names were not alphabetically ordered. The performance of the
  function was also improved by removing extra calls to seqdef.
* Changing the missing.color argument did not work in legends of ssp, ssplot, and
  mssplot.
* The mssplot function now works with unique hidden state names (problem
  occured e.g. with latent class models).
* The mssplot function with sortv = "mds.hidden" produced strange errors when
  plotting clusters with one hidden state. Now automatically uses "mds.obs" in
  such cases.

seqHMM 1.0.5 (Release date: 2016-02-24)
==============

Bug fixes:

* The mssplot function now uses hidden paths instead of posterior probabilities to determine the most probable cluster for each subject (previous solution caused errors when posterior probabilities suggested a different cluster than hidden paths).
* In mssplot, removed a misplaced tlim which caused a warning when plotting state distributions of hidden paths.
* The gridplot function now uses with.missing.legend also with combined legends.



seqHMM 1.0.4 (Release date: 2016-01-14)
==============

* Added examples for build_mmm.
* Added more space for main titles in plot.mhmm.
* Improved documentation.
* Added tlim in ssp functions.

Bug Fixes:

* Corrected mc_to_sc for single state models due to dimension dropping.
* Corrected a bug in plot.hmm when layout = "vertical".
* Fixed legend layout in plot.hmm.
* Wrong nobs and df attributes in mc_to_sc.
* Wrong number of sequences to ssp titles when tlim is used.
* EM with HMM using log-space produced error due to missing element in output of EM.


seqHMM 1.0.3-1 (Release date: 2015-12-29)
==============

As requested by CRAN, changed donttest example of interactive plotting to conditional block depending
on whether session is interactive or not.

seqHMM 1.0.3 (Release date: 2015-12-23)
==============

Corrected dependency on R 3.2.0 due to lengths function.

Bug Fixes:

* Corrected a bug which caused fit_model to stop if restarted EM failed.
* vcov.mhmm produced errors in valgrind, corrected issue by replacing Armadillo's inv_sympd function with inv.
* Corrected a bug relating to colorpalette in mc_to_sc function.

Performance improvements:

* Slight performance improvement in all functions by tweaking the usage of armadillo constructors.

seqHMM 1.0.2-1 (Release date: 2015-12-19)
==============

First version on CRAN.
