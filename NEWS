seqHMM 1.0.5 (Release date: 2016-02-24)
==============

Bug fixes:

* The mssplot function now uses hidden paths instead of posterior probabilities to determine the most probable cluster for each subject (previous solution caused errors when posterior probabilities suggested a different cluster than hidden paths).
* In mssplot, removed a misplaced tlim which caused a warning when plotting state distributions of hidden paths.
* The gridplot function now uses with.missing.legend also with combined legends.



seqHMM 1.0.4 (Release date: 2016-01-14)
==============

* Added examples for build_mmm.
* Added more space for main titles in plot.mhmm.
* Improved documentation.
* Added tlim in ssp functions.

Bug Fixes:

* Corrected mc_to_sc for single state models due to dimension dropping.
* Corrected a bug in plot.hmm when layout = "vertical".
* Fixed legend layout in plot.hmm.
* Wrong nobs and df attributes in mc_to_sc.
* Wrong number of sequences to ssp titles when tlim is used.
* EM with HMM using log-space produced error due to missing element in output of EM.


seqHMM 1.0.3-1 (Release date: 2015-12-29)
==============

As requested by CRAN, changed donttest example of interactive plotting to conditional block depending
on whether session is interactive or not.

seqHMM 1.0.3 (Release date: 2015-12-23)
==============

Corrected dependency on R 3.2.0 due to lengths function.

Bug Fixes:

* Corrected a bug which caused fit_model to stop if restarted EM failed.
* vcov.mhmm produced errors in valgrind, corrected issue by replacing Armadillo's inv_sympd function with inv.
* Corrected a bug relating to colorpalette in mc_to_sc function.

Performance improvements:

* Slight performance improvement in all functions by tweaking the usage of armadillo constructors.

seqHMM 1.0.2-1 (Release date: 2015-12-19)
==============

First version on CRAN.
